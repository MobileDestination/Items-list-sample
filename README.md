# Description 
One of the controllers of "Minimum viable product" app. The used architecture allows to add the changes into this controller 
in the most effective way. At this stage the priority was to develop the app within a limited amount of time - some f
unctionality was simplified (for ex., dependencies were specified directly in the classes, "Router" was missed), and 
will be implemented during the further development
